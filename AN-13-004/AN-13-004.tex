% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.

\abstract{
A search for the production of a massive W' boson at an integrated luminosity of 19.7~fb$^{-1}$ is presented.  
We consider the hadronic decay of $W' \to tb$, focusing on events with sufficiently high mass to produce 
highly boosted quarks.  A typical event has a dijet topology composed of a bottom quark and top quark, in which the decay 
products of the latter are merged into a single jet.  Standard model hadronic jet background is reduced by utilizing jet substructure algorithms to identify the top quark jet. 
The production of a right-handed W' with mass below 2.02 TeV is excluded at the 95\% C.L. in the all-hadronic final state.  The increased sensitivity from the combination of the all-hadronic and 
semileptonic final states leads to an exclusion of a right-handed W' with mass below 2.15 TeV at the 95\% C.L. Limits on the W' left- and right-handed couplings are also presented.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
