\section{Semi-leptonic decay channel}
\label{sec:HZZ2l2q}

The semileptonic final state of the ZZ channel is studied in two 
different kinematic regions, the low mass region 
($125 < m_{2\ell2q} < 170$~GeV) and the high mass region 
($183 < m_{2\ell2q} < 800$~GeV).  Because of the small ZZ branching ratio
expected from the SM Higgs, the intermediate range 
($170 < m_{2\ell2q} < 183$~GeV) is not considered in this analysis.

\subsection{Event Simulation}
\label{sec:HZZ2l2qSimulation}

The analysis strategy, including selections and data-driven
background estimations, were optimized and validated on MC
simulations.  Signal samples are generated with
{\verb+POWHEG+}~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2008gx} and {\verb+JHUGen+}~\cite{Gao:2010qx}.  
Inclusive Z production is generated with either {\verb+MADGRAPH+}
4.4.12~\cite{Alwall:2007st} or {\verb+ALPGEN+} 2.13~\cite{Mangano:2002ea}.  Continuum
diboson production, ZZ, WW, and ZW, samples are generated with
{\verb+PYTHIA+} 6.4.22~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za}.  Top backgrounds are generated
with either {\verb+MADGRAPH+} 4.4.12 or {\verb+POWHEG+}.  Parton
distribution functions are modeled using {\verb+CTEQ6+}~\cite{Kretzer:2003it}
at leading order and {\verb+CT10+}~\cite{Lai:2010vv} at next-to-leading
order (NLO).  Parton showering and hadronization is modeled with
{\verb+PYTHIA+} while detector response is simulated with a CMS
specific implementation of {\verb+GEANT4+}~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}.  A full
list of the MC samples used is shown in
table~\ref{table:HZZ2l2qMCsamples} along with the cross section
for each process.  MC simulations are corrected for mismodelling
of pileup and any relative efficiencies found between data and
MC through tag and probe measurements

\subsection{Event Reconstruction, Selection, and Categorisation}
\label{sec:HZZ2l2qselection}

Reconstruction of electron, muons, and jets is done using
standard CMS algorithms.  More details can be found elsewhere~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012sn} and references therein.  Only events which contain
two oppositely charge leptons, either electrons or
muons, and two jets are considered in this analysis.  Both leptons
flavors are required to have tranverse momentum, $p_T$, greater
than 20~GeV
and 10~GeV for the leading and subleading $p_T$, respectively.  For events 
which are used in the high mass analysis, this constraint is tightened to 
$p_T>40, 20$~GeV.  Only muons (electrons) in the pseudorapidity range 
$|\eta|<2.4 (2.5)$.  Electrons are also excluded the gap between the barrel and endcap region, 
are considered.  These selections not only serve as a rudimentary method for
rejecting background but are consistent with the double electron and 
double muon triggers that are used.  Muons are required to be well 
isolated from hadronic activity in the detector by restricting the sum of
transverse momentum from the tracker or transverse energy in the ECAL and
HCAL within a cone of $\Delta R  = \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}<0.3$
to be less than 15\% of the measured $p_T$.  Similar requirements are placed
on electrons although the details depend also on the electron shower shape.

%Jets are reconstructed with the particle-flow (PF)
%algorithm~\cite{}.
Reconstructed particle candidates are clustered with the
anti-$k_T$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp,Cacciari:2011ma} with a clustering parameter $R=0.5$.
Jets are required to be in the tracker acceptance, $|\eta|<2.4$,
to maximize the effectiveness of the PF algorithm.  Energy
corrections  are applied to jets to account for systematic
instrumental effects including the non-linear energy response
of the calorimeters.  These corrections are derived from in-situ
measurements~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.  Effects of pileup
are mitigated by applying corrections according to the Fastjet
algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.  Some requirement is also applied to the
energy balance between the charged and neutral hadronic 
content in each jet.  In some cases, jet substructure variables are used
to distinguish on a statistical bases differences between gluon jets and
quark jets. Quark jets are removed from consideration.  Finally, all jets are required to have $p_T>30$~GeV.

requirements. }
\label{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

With the basic objects in hand, the $2\ell2q$ system is
constructed under the assumption that all pairs of leptons
and quarks are the duaghters of Z bosons.  Each di-lepton
pair must have a combined invariant mass of 
$70 < m_{\ell\ell} < 110$~GeV, thus reducing backgrounds which
don't have an intermediate Z, like $t\bar{t}$ and QCD backgrounds.
In order to reduce the overwhelming Z+jets background, the dijet
invariant mass of the event is required to satisfy
$75 < m_{jj} < 105$~GeV.  
Figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly} shows the $m_{jj}$ for
signal and background. 

Categorizing events based on jet flavor provides a significant 
increase in sensitivity to signal events since b-jets are 
more likely to result from a Z decay than from QCD radiation
in the Z+jets process.  Furthermore, QCD radiation contains a 
large amount of gluon-jets, while the Z boson cannot decay into
a pair of qluons. 
To isolate jets which are likely to originate from b-quarks,
the CMS track 
counting high-efficiency (TCHE) b-tagging algorithm~\cite{CMS:2010hua,CMS:2012vta} 
is used.  This algorithm relies on tracks within the jet cone
having large impact parameters, indicating a displaced vertex.
This information
is encompassed in a discriminant which is used
to determine how b-like jets and is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly}.
Using this discriminant, the events are divided into three
categories: those which have at least one jet passing the median 
working point ($\sim65\%$ efficient\footnote{More information 
on b-tagging efficiencies and mistagging rates can be found 
elsewhere~\cite{CMS:2010hua,CMS:2012vta}}) and another jet passing the
loose working point ($\sim80\%$ efficient); those which have at 
least one jet passing the loose working point; those which 
have zero jets passing the loose working point.  Although there 
is a non-negligible mistag rate for each of these working points, 
the categories are referred to as 2 b-tag, 1 b-tag, and 
0 b-tag, respectively. The categories are defined such that 
they are mutually exclusive by putting events in the category 
with the most stringent requirements.  Gluon-like jets are 
removed from the 0 b-tag category.  The division of events
in each of the three categories is shown if 
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly}.

Since there is a significant amount of $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ 
events in the 2 b-tag category, events in which the PF candidate
collection has a significant inbalance of transverse energy, 
also known as missing transverse energy, $E_T^{miss}$, are removed.
To quantify this, a likelihood ratio, $\lambda(E_T^{miss})$,
is built comparing two hypothesis, $E_T^{miss}=0$ and 
$E_T^{miss}\neq 0$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011tn}.  Events in the 2 b-tag category are then 
required to satisfy $2\ln\lambda(E_T^{miss})<10$.  In the 
low mass analysis, we instead require $E_T^{miss}<50$~GeV in
the 2 b-tag category.    

\begin{center}
{\bf MELA Discriminant}
\end{center}
In order to further reduce the overwhelming background, Z+jets,
in the high mass analysis, the MELA technique is employed.  
The five angular variables described in 
chapter~\ref{sec:HiggsPhen} are used.  Above threshold, the 
Z masses provide little discrimination power and are dropped 
for simplicity.  The discrimant makes use of the 
5D probability distributions, 
$\mathscr{P}(\cos\theta^*,\cos\theta_1,\cos\theta_2,\Phi,\Phi_1|m_{ZZ})$,
according to
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{\mathscr{P}_{Higgs}}{\mathscr{P}_{Higgs}+\mathscr{P}_{Zjets}}.
\label{eq:KD}
\end{equation}
The expected and observed
distributions for these 5 angles for both signal and background
are shown in figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qAngularLD}.

Since the ideal distributions for the dominant background 
cannot be described analytically in terms of the angular variables, 
the distributions are found 
emperically from MC, including all detector effects, 
 asssuming no correlations between 
the 5 angular variables.  The $\cos\theta_1$, $\cos\theta_2$, 
and $\cos\theta^*$ projections are modelled with even polynomials
in the corresponding variable.  This makes use of prior knowledge
that the distributions should be symmetric.  In addition, 
the $\cos\theta_2$ projection includes a fermi-dirac distribution
to model the sharp acceptance effect found with the hadronic
Z near $\cos\theta_2=1$.  In general, acceptance effects arrise
near $\cos\theta_{1,2}=1$ from pseudorapidity cuts.  In this, 
case, $\cos\theta_2$ describes the angular distributions of the
jets in the rest frame of its parent Z and the finite extent of
the jet enhances the acceptance effect.  The $\Phi$ and $\Phi_1$
projections are modelled with a finite fourier series.
Fits to Z+jets MC are performed in slices of $m_{ZZ}$.  The 
parameters of these fits are then interpolated slices so
that $\mathscr{P}_{Zjets}$ is continuous in $m_{ZZ}$.  
Some examples of these fits are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qBackgroundPDF}.  

The signal parameterization must also include detector effects.
The ideal distributions from section~\ref{sec:HiggsPhen} are 
modified with 5D uncorrelated function which is then fit to 
MC to account for any detector effects.  The parameterization 
of detector effects is the same as those used for describing
background. Also as with background, these fits are performed
in slices of $m_{ZZ}$ and extrapolated to arbitrary values.
Examples of the signal parameterizations are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qSignalPDF}.  

Combining these two density
functions together, the discriminant, D, is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qAngularLD}.  The signal events tend to
peak more towards 1 while the background events tend to peak
more towards zero.  This variable is then used to select 
signal-like events.
Because the shape of D changes with $m_{ZZ}$, the optimal cut will 
be $m_{ZZ}$ dependent. An optimization was run using
$\kappa=N_{sig}/\sqrt{N_{bkg}}$ as a figure of merit.  This variable
represents an approximation of the expected upper limit, UL.  For
a simple counting experiment in which the 
expected number of background events is large, $\kappa$ is a good
approximation of the true UL.  The optimization was performed 
separately for each of the three b-tagging categories and the
proposed D cuts along with the cuts used for other variables
are shown in table~\ref{table:HZZ2l2qCuts}.

The angular variables which are used as input to the angular D represent 
a set of variables which are only loosely correlated with the final discriminating 
variable, $m_{ZZ}$.  As a result, cutting on this variables does not significantly
alter the shape of the $m_{ZZ}$ distribution.  In constrast, an optimized set of 
cuts on more traditional variables
($p_{T,lepton}$, $p_{T,jet}$, $p_{T,\ell\ell}$, 
$\Delta R_{jets}$), which are highly correlated with $m_{ZZ}$, 
would produce a peaked for background as well as signal.  This
is demonstrated in figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qShapeBias}, where an
optimized cut on both sets of variables is applied and the 
resulting $m_{ZZ}$ is shown.  The preservation of the $m_{ZZ}$ 
shape allows for the expected background distribution to be
easily described through simple analytical functions which 
can then be used for and used for statistical interpretation
of the final observed distributions.

\subsection{Yields and Kinematics Distributions}
\label{sec:HZZ2l2qyields}

From figures~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly} and~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qAngularLD}
it is clear that the agreement between data and MC is fairly good.  
Although there are some disagreements in some of the distributions,
these disagreements reflect the complexity that exists in modeling
inclusive Z production.  To ensure that background estimations are
reliable in the more restricted phase space of the final selections,
it is important to have a methodology for measuring background 
shapes and normalizations directly from data.

Data control regions are defined using events passing all
of the final selctions in table~\ref{table:HZZ2l2qCuts} but instead
lie in the regions $60 < m_{jj} < 75$~GeV or $105 < m_{jj} < 130$~GeV. 
These regions are mutually exclusive from the signal region, 
$75<m_{jj}<105$~GeV, and include
only a small contribution from signal events, as evident from 
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qPreselectiOnly}.  Since the kinematics of
this control region are not expected to be exactly the same as 
the signal 
region, events are reweighted to account for the 
differences between the signal region and the control region. 
The expected number
of background events in a given $m_{ZZ}$ range can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
N_{bkg}(m_{ZZ}) = N_{CR}(m_{ZZ})\times\frac{N_{bkg}^{sim}(m_{ZZ})}{N_{CR}^{sim}(m_{ZZ})}=N_{CR}(m_{ZZ})\times\alpha(m_{ZZ}),
\label{eq:HZZ2l2qAlpha}
\end{equation}
where $N_{bkg}$ is the number of events expected in data in the 
signal region, $N_{CR}$ is the number of events observed in the
data control region, and $N_{CR}^{sim}$, $N_{bkg}^{sim}$ are the 
events measured in the MC control region and signal region, 
respectively.  Thus, $\alpha$ represents the weight for
extrapolating
between the signal and control region and is calculated using
MC simulation.
These weights range between 0.75 and 1.2 and have been calculated
with two different MC generators, 
{\verb+MADGRAPH+} and {\verb+SHERPA+}, 
both give statistically compatible results.  Both the expected 
shape and normalization of the SM background are calculated with
this method for each o the three b-tag categories separately.  

Once the expected distributions are calculated, the shape of the
background is fit using an empirical
function.  A crystal ball function multiplied by a fermi-dirac
distribution was found to provide a good description of the 
background in the three different b-tag categories in MC.
The uncertainties of the fit parameters and the statistical 
uncertainties on $\alpha$ are taken as systematic
uncertainties in the background estimation for the 
final statistical analysis.  
Figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qMassDistributions} shows the expected 
shape and normalization of the $m_{ZZ}$ distribution
taken directly from MC (filled histograms), 
the data-driven estimation of the background shape and normalization
(blue line), and the observed distribution from data (points with 
error bars). Although
the MC generally does a reasonably good job of describing the 
observed distribution, there are some minor systematic effects which 
are corrected for by the data-driven estimation.  The SM Higgs
expectation enhanced by a factor 2 (5) or a Higgs mass of 400 (150)~GeV 
is also shown in yellow.

limits in each category.}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

While the background shapes and event yields are derived from data, the signal
model is derived from MC simulations.  Signal production cross sections
and branching ratios are taken from the LHC Higgs Cross Sections Working
Group and 
others~\cite{Anastasiou:2008tj,deFlorian:2009hc,Baglio:2010ae,Dittmaier:2011ti,Djouadi:1991tka,Dawson:1990zj,Spira:1995rr,Harlander:2002wh,Anastasiou:2002yz,Ravindran:2003um,Catani:2003zt,Actis:2008ug,Aglietti:2004nj,Anastasiou:2008tj,Ciccolini:2007jr,Ciccolini:2007ec,Figy:2003nv,Arnold:2008rz,Bolzoni:2010xr,Figy:2010ct,Djouadi:1997yw,Bredenstein:2006rh,Bredenstein:2006ha}
production cross sections are calculated at NNLO.  Signal
efficiencies are taken from CMS simulations and are
corrected for known differences between data and MC using tag and
probe measurements.  The efficiencies are also interpolated to 
intermediate values of $m_H$ using a polynomial fit.  
Figures~\ref{fig:efficiencyHighMass}
and~\ref{fig:efficiencyLowMass}
shows the efficiency curves for each of the 6 categories.  The 
efficiencies together with the production cross section and
branching ratio are used to derive the expected event yields.

Signal shapes are modeled using both
{\verb+POWHEG+} to model the production of Higgs bosons at
NLO in $\alpha_s$ and {\verb+PYTHIA+} to model the decay
kinematics.  In order to get a good description of the signal
shape, events are fit in two separate categories.  Those in which 
both the jets used to build the Z are matched to generator level 
quarks from the Higgs decay, and those in which the jets are not 
matched.  The latter category represents event in which the Higgs 
was mis-reconstructed and thus is expected to have a much broader 
distribution.  Matched events are fit with a double crystal ball
function (i.e. a gaussian distribution whose tails are described
by two independent power law distributions).  Unmatched events
are fit with a triangle function convoluted with a crystal ball 
function.  Signal samples corresponding to different mass
hypotheses, $m_H$, are fit separately and the shape parameters
are then interpolated for intermediate mass hypotheses. This 
procedure is performed separately for each b-tag category.
Examples of the signal shape model are shown for a 130~GeV and
400~GeV Higgs boson for each of the three b-tag categories
separately in figure~\ref{fig:signalShapeModels}.

A number of systematic uncertainties are associated with the calculation
of the number of expected event yields.  Many of these result from
limited understanding of reconstruction efficiencies.  The 
muon and electron reconstruction effiencies have been assigned 
uncertainties of 2.7\%, 4.5\%, respectively.  Jet effiency
uncertainties due to JES range from 1-8\% depending on the Higgs
mass hypothesis.  The efficiency uncertainty of $E_T^{miss}$ cuts
range from 3-4\%.  The b-tagging efficiency uncertainties depend
both on the category as well as the Higgs mass hypothesis and
range between 2-11\%. 
The additional jet identification requirements applied in the 0~b-tag
category, including gluon-tagging, is assigned an uncertainty of 4.6\%.
Uncertainties from Higgs production, either through parton distribution
functions, missing higher order corrections, or VBF modeling are
assigned to both the overall cross section calculation or the
effect on acceptance due to shape differences.  Theoretical
uncertainties on signal shapes introduce some additional
systematic to the effective amount of event near the signal peak.
Since the width depends strong on the mass hypthosis, $m_H$,
the uncertainties also depends on $m_H$ according to
$1.5\times10^{-7}\%\times m_H^3$ [GeV].  Finally, uncertainties from
luminosity measurements are accounted for in the signal
systematics.  All systematic uncertainties on the signal yields
are summarized in table~\ref{table:HZZ2l2qSystematics}.

\subsection{Results of Semilepton Analysis}
\label{sec:HZZ2l2qxsec}

The expected background event yields, both from MC simulation and
from the data-driven estimations, and expected signal event yields
are compared against the observed event yields in each of the
three b-tag categories in table~\ref{table:HZZ2l2qYields}.
Since there are no significant excesses found in any of the
observed invariant mass spectra, limits on the Higgs cross section
are calculated.

A simultaneous fit of the $m_{ZZ}$ distributions for the signal 
cross section in the six different channels is perform using a 
dedicated statistical software package discussed in 
ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012tx}.  Using the distribution of the $CL_S$ test 
statistic~\cite{Read:2002hq}, 95\% confidence level (CL) limits are
calculated.  Expected limits are derived from pseudoexperiments
which are generated based on expected distributions.  Nuisance
parameters associated with the different systematic uncertainties
are randomized when generating toys and profiled in fits.  

The expected and observed  distributions of the 
95\% CL upper limit on the ratio of the observed cross section
with respect to the Higgs cross section,
$\sigma_{95\%}/\sigma_{SM}$, is shown 
figure~\ref{fig:HZZ2l2qLimits}.  While the low mass region
limits are at best around several times SM Higgs cross sections, 
the high mass region has an expected exclusion for Higgs masses 
in the range [310,460]~GeV. The observed data excludes Higgs boson 
masses in the range [340,390]~GeV.
