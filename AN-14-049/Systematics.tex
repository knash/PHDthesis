\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:bssystematics}
Various systematics are taken into account, both 
on our expected signal and background estimate. Some systematic uncertainties will affect only the normalization of certain event rates, 
and are reported as overall normalization uncertainties. Other systematics affect the shapes of the reconstructed signal or backgrounds, as well as their normalization.  
%The Systematic uncertainties that are used in the analysis are summarized in table \ref{table:bsnuisance}.

\section{Jet Energy Scale}
We evaluate the effect of uncertainty on the jet energy scale on samples derived from Monte Carlo simulation.  
To do so, we vary the jet four-momentum up and down by the jet energy 
scale uncertainty, which is $\pt$ and $\eta$ dependent.  Wâ€Že take an additional $3\%$ uncertainty to account 
for the use of CA8 jets as derived from the difference in measured and simulated $W$ masses \cite{ZP8TeV}. 

Varying the jet momentum can cause a jet to fall below or rise above the $\pt$ cut in the analysis, thus shifting the invariant 
mass spectrum of the signal and reconstructed $\ttbar$ samples. Figure \ref{figs:bsttbarJES} shows the systematic shapes from the 
jet energy scale on the $\ttbar$ distribution.  Jet Energy scale variation on signal Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bssignalJES} for 1200$~\GeV$,
 1300$~\GeV$, and 1400$~\GeV$ mass points.

\section{Trigger}
We include an uncertainty based on the measured trigger efficiency for all Monte Carlo Samples. The trigger efficiency is discussed in Section \ref{sec:bstrigger}. 
To obtain shape systematics from this effect, we vary the trigger by half the trigger \textit{in}efficiency (figure~\ref{figs:bsteffsys}). The effects of this on the $\ttbar$ 
distribution is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bsttbartrig}. Trigger weighting on signal Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bssignaltrig} for 1200$~\GeV$,
 1300$~\GeV$, and 1400$~\GeV$ mass points.  The uncertainty is low in the mass range of interest for limit setting.

\section{Jet Energy Resolution}
\label{sec:bsJER}
We apply a systematic due to the known differences in jet energy resolution in data and simulation.  We use the nominal$\eta$ dependent smearing (see \cite{ZP8TeV}) as recommended by the JER group.  
We apply the reccomended systematic uncertainty to this nominal smearing to the $t\overline{t}$ and signal $M_{tW}$ distribution. 
The jet energy resolution variation in $\ttbar$ Monte Carlo can be seen in Figure \ref{figs:bsttbarJER}.  Jet energy resolution variation on signal Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bssignalJER} for 1200$~\GeV$,
 1300$~\GeV$, and 1400$~\GeV$ mass points. 

\section{Jet Angular Resolution}
A smearing of $10\%$ is assumed on $\eta$ and $\phi$ and shape uncertainties are generated by considering smearing $10\%$ 
lower and higher. We apply this systematic uncertainty to the $t\overline{t}$ and signal $M_{tW}$ distribution.  The jet angular resolution variation in $\ttbar$ Monte Carlo can be seen in Figure \ref{figs:bsttbarJAR} . Jet Angular Resolution 
variation on signal Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bssignalJAR} for 1200$~\GeV$,
 1300$~\GeV$, and 1400$~\GeV$ mass points.  The effect is very small and thus not considered in setting limits.

\section{PDF Uncertainty}
The uncertainty in the parton distribution function used for Monte Carlo sample generation is investigated.  We take the average of the $\pm$1$\sigma$ eigenvalue 
variation of the pdf master equations \cite{Bourilkov:2006cj} 
for the NNPDF, MSTW2008nnlo, and CT10 pdf sets to weight the signal and $\ttbar$ Monte Carlo samples and investigate the impact on the full selection.  From this we get three 
approximations of the PDF uncertainty. 
Of these uncertainty approximations, the PDF set that provides the maximum uncertainty is then used for the $\pm$1$\sigma$ PDF uncertainty.  For the $\ttbar$ sample this set is NNPDF and for the signal samples this set is either NNPDF or CT10. PDF 
variation on signal Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bssignalPDF} for 1200$~\GeV$,
 1300$~\GeV$, and 1400$~\GeV$ mass points.  PDF variation on $\ttbar$ Monte Carlo is shown in Figure \ref{figs:bsttbarPDF}.  The effect is very small and thus not considered in setting limits.

\section{Pileup}
A study of pileup uncertainty is conducted by varying the minimum bias cross-section by 5\% as a measure of systematic uncertainty.  The results 
can be seen in figure \ref{figs:bssignalPU}.  The effect is very small and thus not considered in setting limits.

\section{$Q^2$ Scale Uncertainty}
We use additional $\ttbar$ samples generated with twice and half the nominal $Q^2$ 
scale used in the $\ttbar$ samples listed in table \ref{table:bsdatasets}.  These samples vary the renormalization and factorization scales to account for 
missing higher order corrections in our simulation.  Figure \ref{figs:bsq2scale} shows the shape based uncertainty due to this effect.

\caption{
$Q^2$ systematic variation for $\ttbar$ Monte Carlo

\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Normalization Uncertainties}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:bsttbarsideband}, the uncertainty on the overall normalization scale factor used for $\ttbar$ is extracted from data and is $22\%$.   

We must apply a $13\%$ uncertainty on the top tagging scale factor described in Section \ref{sec:bssubjetSF} to signal Monte Carlo events due to uncertainty in the difference in subjet efficiency from data to Monte Carlo.

The cross-section uncertainty of 20\%,15\%,30\% applies single-top quark background tW,t,and s channels respectively are applied.

We also include a $2.6\%$ uncertainty in the luminosity for the signal Monte Carlo \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-13-001}.

\section{Uncertainties Related to the QCD Background Estimate}
We use the result of the fit to the top-mistagging rate (see Section \ref{sec:bsbackgroundEstimation}) to weight 
pre top-tagged events in order to create the QCD background estimate.  Uncertainties in
the fitting algorithm and statistical uncertainties in the sideband
are taken into account (see figure \ref{figs:bstagrateetafit}).
Statistical uncertainties in the pre b tagged signal region are also
taken into account.

\subsection{Choice of the Functional Form for the Average Top-Mistagging Rate}
\label{sec:bschoiceoffit}
The functional form used is a bifurcated polynomial.
However there is a systematic uncertainty associated with this choice.
The uncertainties due to this effect are taken into account by
studying alternative functional forms seen in figure
\ref{figs:bsBKGFITCOMP}.  The background estimation from these
alternative fits are seen in figure \ref{figs:bsBKGCOMP}.  The
uncertainty due to the choice of fit is taken as the Mean Squared
Error of these alternative backgrounds bin by bin and can be seen in
figure \ref{figs:bsBKGERR}.  

\subsection{Top Candidate Mass Correction}
\label{sec:bsmascorrerror}
The correction of the top candidate mass is detailed in section \ref{sec:bsmodmass}.  The uncertainty on this procedure is taken as one half of the correction 
and is shown in Figures \ref{figs:bsmodmass} and \ref{figs:bsdatatmass}.   

\subsection{Two-Dimensional  vs. Three-Dimensional Parameterization of the Average Top-Mistagging Rate}
\label{sec:bsparamerrors1}
Additionally, we place an uncertainty on the inability of the
background estimate to capture all kinematic correlations through the
parameterization of the top-mistagging rate in $\pt$ and $\eta$.
This uncertainty is calculated by investigating a parameterization in
$\pt$ $\eta$ and $M_{tW}$.  We define $P_i$ as the top-mistagging
rate described in Section \ref{sec:bsbackgroundEstimation} in one
$\eta$ bin and $P_{ij}$ as the top-mistagging rate if parameterized
with $M_{tW}$ as well.  $P_{ij}$ can be seen in
figure \ref{figs:bssb2deta}.  Each bin in $P_i$ can be thought of as a
column average over all $M_{tW}$ bins per $\pt$ bin.  If $P_{ij}$ a
function of $M_{tW}$ (index $j$) is not constant, then averaging over
$P_{ij}$ over $j$ while projecting onto $M_{tW}$ axis to obtain the
QCD background estimate can result in a bias.  
%For more in-depth discussion on this effect, please see Section \ref{sec:bsqcdpunc}.

We assess the approximate size of the uncertainty due to our choice of
parameterization by explicitly comparing the three-dimensional and
two-dimensional background estimates in the sideband.  Using these two
parameterizations, the uncertainty in the $M_{tW}$ distribution due to
parameterization is approximately $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=0}^n
m_{ij}$($P_{ij}-P_i$) where $m_{ij}$ refers to the number of pretag
events for a bin in $\pt$ and $M_{tW}$.  Fig. \ref{figs:bsPARAMERROR}
shows the uncertainty due to this effect.  The addition of a dimension to the top-mistagging rate parameterization 
leads to lower statistical power.  The additional uncertainty from including $M_{tW}$ in the top-mistagging rate 
parameterization is taken into account by an additional uncertainty on the QCD shape.  For this, we use the $\pm$1$\sigma$ deviations from the 3d parameterized top-mistagging rate to 
extract the $M_{tW}$ shape instead of the nominal value.  Additionally, the uncertainty due to the 2d parameterization is subtracted from this shape in quadrature due to the fact that this is already included as an uncertainty.  
The uncertainty due to this can be seen in figure \ref{figs:bsPARAMERRORstat}.

These uncertainties are
taken in quadrature to produce an overall uncertainty in the data
derived background estimate that is applied in a shape based manner in
the limit-setting macro.
