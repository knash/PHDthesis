Similar to the $\wpr$ search, the primary sources of background are QCD multijet and SM $\ttbar$ 
production.  

The QCD background component is estimated by a tagging rate based data driven technique similar 
to the $\wpr$ search (see section~\ref{sec:qcdBackgroundEstimationProcedure}).  We invert the W candidate mass requirement in order to define a control region with negligible signal contribution.  
This region is used to investigate the mistagging rate for the top tagging algorithm used in the analysis.  
This top-mistagging rate is then used to weight events in lieu of a top-tag in our full selection.  This allows for an estimation of the 
QCD background component with a low signal pollution component.  This procedure is first applied to a control region in order to  
investigate any potential bias, and is then applied to the signal region selection (see Section \ref{sec:bssideband}). 

The shape of the Standard Model $\ttbar$ production contribution is estimated from Monte Carlo simulation.  The normalization of this contribution is 
measured in a third control region that is enriched in $\ttbar$ production (see Section \ref{sec:bsttbarsideband}).

The data and background components are then used as templates by the Bayesian statistical procedure identical to the $\wpr$ search
