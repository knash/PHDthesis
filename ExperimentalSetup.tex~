To look for BSM physics, we want to create new massive particles.  
For this, we collide lighter particles at a high energy.  
The collision may create one of these new particles, and from it's decay products an experimenter can reconstruct the properties of BSM physics that created the massive state.  

For the measurements presented in this thesis, we collide high energy proton beams.  
This type of collider is designed to preduce a high collision energy in comparison to fixed-target or electron-positron colliders.   
   
\section{Luminosity and Cross Section}
To understand how many occurances of any physical process to expect in a set of collisions, we need to define at a minimum the concepts of luminosity,L, and cross section, \sigma.

The cross section of a process is a measurement of how likely a collision will result in the process of interest.  
The phrase cross section refers to the physical cross section of a classical target and is thus measured in units of area.  
In a high energy collision, the cross section no longer refers to the physical dimensions of the target, and can be calculated directly from Feynman diagrams.  
The areas associated with these cross sections is very small and is measured in barns (b), which is 10^{-28} m^2.  
BSM physics signatures have cross sections that are gnerally on the order of picobarns (pb) or femptobarns (fb).  
The process cross section is highly dependent of the energy of the collision and is why it is very important to have large, high energy accelerators for the discovery of new physics.  
The cross section of some SM processes are shown in Figure \ref{FIG}.
  
Luminosity is a measure of the intensity of the colliding beams and is the number of collisions expected per unit time per unit area.  
To look for BSM physics, we need to collect an ensemble of useful collisions (events), and thus higher luminosity leads to a larger ensemble and higher statistical precision.  
Additionally, collecting data over time leads to a larger ensemble, so the time-integrated luminosity is a more useful variable to describe the total amount of data collected, 
which is reported in \fbinv.

With these two concepts we can extract the predicted number of events for a given process,$N_{\mathrm{i}}$: 
\begin{eqnarray}
N_{\mathrm{i}} = \int L \mathrm{d}t \times \sigma_{\mathrm{i}} 
\label{eqn:Nevents}
\end{eqnarray}  

\section{The LHC}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator designed to reach collisions energies far surpassing any previous design.  
The LHC is a synchrotron that is capable of accelerating protons to 99.999997\% the speed of light.  
These protons beams are then collided at a center-of-mass energy (\sqrt{s}) of 8 \TeV.

The life of a proton at the LHC starts out as hydrogen gas within the injector of LINAC 2 linear accelerator.  
The atoms are then ionized using an electric field, and resulting proton is accelerated with an external electric field using RF cavities to charge cylindrical conductors.  
The protons are accelerated in a straight line to an energy of 50\MeV, or 31\%the speed of light.  

At this energy, linear acceleration is not practical, and the protons enter the Proton Synchrtron Booster PSB.  
The PSB is composed of four 157 m circumference superimposed synchrotrons that accelerate the protons using electric fields that are synchronized to the revolution frequency of the beams.  
The protons are kept on the circular accelerator with a magnetic field directed into the plane formed by the accelerator ring, which increases in strength as the protons gain energy.   .   
After the acceleration from the booster, the protons are at en energy of 1.4\GeV, or 92\%the speed of light.

After the PSB, the protons enter the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which is a 628 m circumference synchrotron, which accelerates the protons to 25\GeV, or 99.93\%the speed of light.  
After the PS, the protons enter the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), which is a 7 km circumference synchrotron, which accelerates the protons to 450\GeV, or 99.9998\%the speed of light.

Finally, the beams enter the LHC.  This is the final synchrotron ring, with a circumference of 27 km.  
After the SPS, the protons are inserted into the LHC in one of two evacuated tunnels depending on which direction around the ring the beam is to travel.  
The LHC uses 1232 dipole magnets that provide an 8.3 T field over their length.  In order to deliver such a field, the magnets use superconducting niobium-titanium cables.  
These cables are cooled by superfluid helium to -271.3 C in order to achieve this superconductivity.  
AFter being fully accelerated in the LHC, the protons are at an energy of 4\TeV, or 99.999997\%the speed of light.

The proton beams are directed together to collide.  Each beam in the LHC ring contains 2808 bunches of protons, and each bunch contains 110 billion protons. 
These bunches need to be collimated in order to maximize collision frequency, which is accomplished by the use of 392 focusing quadrupole magnets.   
The beams are brought together for collisions in four positions around the ring.  
Each of these collision points houses its own detector, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb.  
CMS and ATLAS are large general purpose detectors.  The ALICE detector is primarily used for experiments involving heavy ion collisions.  
LHCb is specialized for physics involving b quarks, such as measuring CP violation parameters from b-hadron interactions.

  


  

\section{CMS detector}
The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is one of two large all purpose detectors at the LHC (the other being Atlas). 
The purpose of this detector is to measure properties of particles that are created in a collision such as the energy and trajectory. 
The detector needs to supply enough information so that particles can be reconstructed and classified.  
Generally, we can reconstruct most physics signatures by analyzing electrons, muons, photon, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons. 
The CMS detector has dedicated algorithms and systems that are specifically designed to identify each of these categories.  

In order to extract these physical quantities, we impose a uniform axial magnetic field throughout the inner detector with the use of a superconducting magnet. 

The trajectory of charged particles is important to extract information such as charge and momentum.  
To extract this information, two dedicated systems are used.  
Near the interaction point tracks are very dense, and tracking becomes very difficult.  
In this region we use a fine array of silicon pixels that register a charge particles position based on charge deposited in the device.  
Additional measurements are made by the second series of silicon detectors called the Silicon Strip Tracker. 
Using a series of these position measurements, we can fit a charged particle track.  

Energy can be measured  by the use of calorimeter systems.  
A calorimeter is a detector designed such that a particle will deposit all of its energy within the detector in the form of photons, 
which can be detected to extract a measure of the total energy. 
These systems are subdivided into the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) and Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL).  
The ECAL uses scintillation crystals to detect particles that interact primarily with the electromagnetic force such as electrons and photons.  
Hadrons pass through the ECAL with minimal loss and deposit energy in the HCAL, which uses layers of absorber and scintillator to first 
create a shower of secondary particles, and then measure the total energy of these secondary particles.  

The detection of muons requires a specially designed system that lies outside of the ECAL, HCAL, and magnet.  
Muons pass through the ECAL and HCAL without losing a substantial fraction of their energy.  
To reconstruct the trajectory of muons, we use several different tracking systems both inside and outside the magnet.

See Figure \ref{FIG} for a diagram of these systems.
