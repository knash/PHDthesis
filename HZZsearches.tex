\chaptermark{Higgs searches with ZZ decays}

The ZZ channel is particularly well suited for Higgs search, 
especially at high mass ($m_H>200~GeV$)
where the branching ratios to WW and ZZ are dominant.  The ZZ 
channel has the advantage that there are several fully 
reconstructable final states: the $4\ell$ final state and the 
$2\ell 2q$ final state.  While the $4\ell$ channels has very good 
mass resolution and low background, it suffers from low branching 
ratios.  In complement, the 
$2\ell2q$ channel has considerably larger background and mass 
resolution, but the hadronic branching ratio for the Z is large, 
$\mathscr{B}(ZZ\to 2\ell2q)/\mathscr{B}(ZZ\to 4\ell)\sim20$.  The $4\ell$ channel is 
expected to provide high sensitivity to a broad range of Higgs 
mass hypotheses, while the dominant sensitivity for $2\ell 2q$ 
will occur at high mass and only moderate sensitivity can be 
acheived below the ZZ kinematic threshold.

In this chapter, two analyses will be presented in which Higgs 
searches are performed over the entire range of Higgs masses.  
The first section will concentrate on the semileptonic final state.
Novel analysis techniques to reduce and control for the background
are presented.  The sensitivity is found to be competative with 
that expected from the $4\ell$ channel.  The second section will 
discuss Higgs searches in the context of the $4\ell$ final state in
which a significant excess of events has been observed consistent 
with a narrow width neural bosonic resonance.  The corresponding 
cross section of the excess is compared to that of SM Higgs 
expectation and property measurements are performed using event 
kinematics to constrain both the spin and parity of the observed 
resonance.
